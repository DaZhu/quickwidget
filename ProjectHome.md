### Qt 5.3+ provide **QQuickWidget**. Use that solution, if possible. ###

As transparent and masked QQuickViews are currently unavailable/unreliable, this code provides an interim solution.

Please contribute code, if you manage to make this widget more compatible. Currently, I've tested it only on Windows and Linux.
